Go-to-Market & Growth Loops – acquisition channels, partnerships, virality hooks.
Validation Experiments – fastest tests (surveys, concierge, smoke tests) to kill/confirm assumptions.
Regulatory / Ethical / Security Considerations – data, privacy, compliance.
Risks & Mitigations – market, execution, funding, tech, team.
Prioritised Action Plan – 30-, 60-, 90-day roadmap with SMART goals and learning milestones.
Open Questions & Next Steps – 5–7 questions I should answer before investing further.
Output Format
Markdown with clear headings, concise bullet points, and a summary table of the top three alternative strategic directions (with trade-offs).
Tone
Analytical, concise, and jargon-light. Present opposing viewpoints where relevant.

Step 2: “Validate & Differentiate”

User Context 
[PASTE FULL OUTPUT FROM STEP 1 HERE]

Research Objectives
Validate Core Assumptions
Identify the five most critical assumptions the plan relies on (market size, willingness to pay, adoption speed, etc.).
For each, gather the best available evidence for and against it (reports, case studies, datasets, expert quotes).
Rate confidence (High / Medium / Low) and explain why.
Competitive & Alternative Landscape
Map at least 8 direct, indirect, and “do-nothing” substitutes.
Summarise their positioning, pricing, traction signals, funding, and notable strengths/weaknesses.
White-Space & Differentiation Opportunities
From the gaps you observe, list up to 6 promising differentiation angles (feature, UX, GTM, business model, niche focus).
Rank them by potential impact × feasibility; justify with data or analogues.
Customer Evidence & Signals
Compile real quotes, forum threads, social posts, or job ads that illustrate the target users’ pains and unmet needs.
Highlight patterns that either confirm or contradict the concept’s value proposition.
Suggested Validation Experiments
Propose the 3–5 fastest research or prototype tests (≤ 2 weeks each) that would most de-risk the idea.
Specify: goal, method, success metric, and cost/effort estimate.
Output Format
Markdown with these major sections:
## 1. Assumption-Validation Matrix
## 2. Competitive Benchmark Table
## 3. Differentiation Playbook
## 4. Voice-of-Customer Evidence
## 5. Rapid Validation Experiments
## 6. Open Questions & Next Research Steps

• Use concise bullet points and keep each evidence citation to one line (source title – date – link).
• Use only resources with a high evidence base.Use state-of-the-art data.Use Russian-language resources to a lesser extent.Keep in mind that my application is focused on using AI.
Tone
Analytical, neutral, and transparent about evidential strength. Surface counterarguments proactively so the founder can form a balanced view.

Step 3: “Define Your MVP”
Example: https://chatgpt.com/share/68316066-d6e8-8013-b58f-8acf39ecf1a2

Prompt Title: “100-Idea Bold Software Concept Generator”
Prompt
Role
You are a contrarian digital-product strategist who pairs market insight with wild imagination.
Objective
Produce exactly 100 software-only product ideas that could plausibly reach USD $10 000 in monthly revenue. Each idea must target [target audience] in [country/region].
Originality is paramount: no two ideas may overlap in core value proposition, business model, or audience pain point.
Method (follow in order, do not skip steps)
Draft list — titles only
Rapid-fire 100 short working titles (one per line).
Differentiate & amplify
Scan the list and flag any overlaps, clichés, or timid ideas.
Rewrite flagged titles so that every idea is unmistakably distinct and at least 10 % bolder or more surprising than before.
Name + description pass
For each final title, coin a memorable product name, then add a colon and a 40- to 80-word paragraph that:
Explains the core user problem and how the product solves it.
Hints at the monetisation path that enables $10 K / month.
Stays grounded enough to be imaginable, yet ambitious enough to excite.
Format: ProductName: description…
Output format
1. ProductName 1: 40–80-word description…
2. ProductName 2: 40–80-word description…
…
100. ProductName 100: 40–80-word description…

Rules
No duplicates, near-duplicates, or umbrella categories.
Stay within 40–80 words per description (use a word counter).

Begin when ready.

Workshop 2

Idea Maze (Deep Research)
https://chatgpt.com/share/6843bd10-f7f4-8013-b8d0-eb3aff0fec1a 

**Context**  
You are a seasoned founder-analyst who applies Balaji Srinivasan’s *idea-maze* framework: great startups map every fork, trap, and tech shift that shaped their market. Your task is to chart that maze for a new concept.

**Inputs**  
1. **Idea (one-liner)** – [insert concise statement]  
2. **Market-research doc(s)** – [paste or attach key report(s)]  
3. *Optional:* Additional data (user interviews, regulatory notes, unit-economics snapshots)

**Goal**  
Produce a strategic **Idea-Maze Map** that reveals  
- Historical branches competitors explored and where they died or thrived  
- New “doors” opened by tech, regulation, or behaviour shifts  
- The riskiest pits ahead and how to test for them fast  
- A recommended path to “treasure” and why it can succeed now

**Deliverables & Structure**  
1. **Maze Entrance & Definition**  
   • Restate the idea in one sentence.  
   • Define the core user/job-to-be-done.  

2. **Maze Topography (Timeline & Branches)**  
   • Draw an ASCII or Mermaid decision-tree with ≥ 5 major strategic branches since the earliest relevant year.  
   • Label each node with company/example, year, and outcome (e.g., “Napster ’99 – DMCA takedown”).  

3. **Pits, Dead-Ends & Minotaurs**  
   • List ≥ 3 past failure modes; cite real firms and root causes.  
   • Explain whether those traps still exist or have shifted.  

4. **Moving Walls / New Doors**  
   • Identify up to 5 recent shifts (tech, cost curves, policy, distribution) that reopen formerly fatal paths.  
   • Attribute each shift to a date/event.  

5. **Competitor Positioning**  
   • Map today’s players onto the maze; highlight occupied paths vs. whitespace.  

6. **Treasure Path Hypothesis**  
   • Propose one primary and one fallback path to pursue now.  
   • For each: a) key bet, b) near-term milestones, c) resources/advantages required.  

7. **Fast Tests & Metrics**  
   • Design 2-3 cheap experiments (landing-page, concierge MVP, expert calls) to validate critical assumptions within 4-6 weeks.  

8. **Annotated Bibliography**  
   • Bullet citations from the provided research plus any additional public data you reference.

**Style Requirements**  
- Use numbered sections, crisp bullets, short paragraphs.  
- Stay analytical and balanced; surface multiple perspectives before choosing a path.  
- Include Mermaid code blocks for diagrams.  
- Mark speculations with “(hypothesis)”.

If data is missing, state the assumption you make before scoring.

1. **Market size & growth rate** – Larger or faster-growing markets score higher.  
2. **Founder / idea fit** – Does the team have an unfair advantage (domain expertise, network, unique insight)?  
3. **Value-proposition type** – “Make money” > “Save money” > “Entertainment.”  
4. **Time to value** – How quickly
5. **Frequency of use case** – How often do target users feel the pain or use the product?  
6. **Timing tailwinds** – Are there new technologies, regulations, or social shifts that create a window of opportunity?  
7. **MVP ≤ 3 months** – Can a functional MVP be shipped within three months?  
8. **Network effects** – Does user growth make the product more valuable for all users?  
9. **Economies of scale** – Do unit economics improve materially with scale?

Workshop 3

User Board Simulation
https://g.co/gemini/share/9446e8aff72b

Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Recommended), reasoning models; ChatGPT o-3, Claude 4 Sonnet/Opus

You are about to simulate a virtual user advisory board debating a new business idea. Follow the rules carefully.

PARTICIPANTS
Moderator – “Alex (MOD)”
  • Neutral facilitator. Lists meeting goals, enforces turn-taking, and synthesizes main points every few rounds.
Persona 1 – “Taylor (Ops Guru)”
  • User archetype whose day-to-day work is most disrupted/improved by the idea. Give short background, job title, pain points, and what success looks like.
Persona 2 – “Jordan (Finance Hawk)”
  • Financial stakeholder. Note background, KPIs they care about, risk tolerance, and why this idea interests them.
Persona 3 – “Riley (Innovation Scout)”
  • Early-adopter personality. Describe industry role, tech savviness, motivations, and what excites them about emerging solutions.
(Feel free to rename personas. Base details on «IDEA_DESCRIPTION».)

CONVERSATION FORMAT
• Prefix every turn with [Name | Role] (e.g., [Taylor | Ops Guru]).  
• Start with the Moderator framing the session (goals + agenda).  
• Each round proceeds: Moderator ➜ Persona 1 ➜ Persona 2 ➜ Persona 3 ➜ (natural cross-talk as needed).  
• Allow organic interruptions if one persona references another.  
• Produce at least 12 total speaker messages (including the moderator).  
• After every 3–4 rounds, the Moderator recaps key agreements, open questions, and assigns “homework” for next time.

DISCUSSION GUIDELINES
1. Depth & Specificity — cite realistic metrics, anecdotes, or hypothetical data.  
2. Conflict welcomed — encourage disagreement; avoid groupthink.  
3. Evolve ideas — each response must build on or challenge something already said.  
4. Practical focus — highlight implementation hurdles, ROI, user experience, and competition.  
5. Wrap-up — Moderator ends with consensus, unresolved issues, and next steps.

TONE & STYLE
• Conversational, professional, candid.  
• Use short bullet lists only when helpful; otherwise natural dialogue.  
• Keep each message to 1–3 short paragraphs; avoid fluff.

INPUTS YOU MUST USE
«IDEA_DESCRIPTION» — a rich paragraph describing the business idea, problem, target customer, and value proposition.

OUTPUT
The full simulated transcript that follows every rule above.
